What is Computer

A computer is an electronic device that can process and store information. It can perform calculations, manipulate data, and execute instructions to accomplish specific tasks. The basic components of a computer include the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage (hard drive or solid-state drive), input devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.), output devices (monitor, printer, etc.), and various peripheral devices (such as USB drives or external hard drives).

- What is CPU? The CPU is often considered the brain of the computer, as it performs most of the processing and calculations required for a computer to function. 
- What is RAM? RAM is the temporary memory that stores data and instructions while the computer is running, 
- What is Storage?storage is the long-term memory where data is stored even when the computer is turned off.
- What is input Devices? Input devices allow users to input data or commands into the computer,
- What is Output Devices? output devices display the results of the computer’s processing.
- What is Peripheral Devices? Peripheral devices are additional components that can be added to a computer to enhance its functionality.

Computers can run different types of software, including operating systems, applications, and games. They can also be connected to the internet and used to access online services, communicate with other people, and share information.

Computer doesn’t have a brain like human beings. We have to give them instructions on what to do when a particular situation arises. We have to tell them everything from what to expect for data(what type of data), how to process it(how to perform calculations) to where to store the data. We humans understand language that is composed of words which further is composed of letters. But, the computers don’t understand our language nor the words like “hello, good morning, discipline, etc”. They only understand binary language whose vocabulary contains only two letters or states or symbols i.e. 0 and 1, True and False, On and Off. To maintain the state transistors are used.
-    Transistors are tiny devices that are used to store 2 values 1 and 0 or on and off.
-    If the transistor is on we say that it has a value of 1, and if it is off the value is 0.

For example, a memory chip contains hundreds of millions or even billions of transistors, each of which can be switched on or off individually. As a transistor can store 2 distinct values, we can have millions of different values stored on a memory chip consisting entirely of 0’s and 1s. But how does a transistor get its value? When a very little amount of electric current passes through the transistor it maintains the state of 1 and when there is no electric current then the transistor has the state of 0. 

Then how it’s all connected to the computer? 

These 0’s and 1’s form the building block of a computer. With the combinations of 0 and 1, we create a whole new language For example, 0 can be written as 0,
1 as 1
2 as 10
3 as 11
4 as 100
5 as 101
a as 01100001
A as 01000001
s as 01110011
U as 01010101

Hello as,

01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 

Hello World! as,

01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 
00100000 01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100 00100001 

And so on… So now the question arises how can a human remember this code?

It seems impossible!

Well, we humans can do everything that we desire and this code can be remembered very easily but we don’t have to remember. We just have to use our language and the software (also built by humans) converts our normal letters into binary language. 

in other words, even tho computers only have 0's and 1's to work with, they can store all the values necessary for math - and perform calculations faster thhan us. in fact, all we have to do is read the translated output off the monitor or priter in english - they can even turn it to english for us!

What is software?

Software is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do, when to do, and how to do it. Examples are, the paint that we use in Microsoft, WhatsApp, and games, all are types of different software.

   ` Software refers to the programs, applications, and operating systems that run on a computer. It provides instructions and enables the computer hardware to perform specific tasks and operations. Software can be classified into two main types:

    System Software: This includes the operating system, device drivers, and utility programs that manage and control the computer’s hardware, memory, and other system resources.

    Application Software: Application software consists of programs designed to perform specific tasks or applications for users. Examples include word processors, web browsers, graphics editors, and database management systems.`

Suppose we want to add 2 numbers and want to know what 2 + 2 is 4. Then we must give the computer instructions,

    Step-1: take 2 values.
    Step-2: a store that 2 value
    Step-3: add 2 value by using + operator
    Step-4: save the answer

Separate instructions are provided for the + operator so the computer knows how to do addition when it encounters the + sign. So who converts this code? Instead of who we can ask what converts the code. And answer to that question is a software called interpreter that interprets our language code into binary code. The interpreter converts our code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. 
Now the question is how we give our input. 

We give our input with the use of hardware for example like scanner, keyboard, and mouse(not the one that eats cheese). When we give input through hardware, the software interprets it into machine language and then it is processed and our output is shown. 

Process: If we want to display the letter ‘A’ on the screen we first will open the notepad. Then we will press the Capslock key or shift key to make the letter capital, after that, we will press the letter ‘a’. And our screen will show the letter ‘A’. 

Under the hood process: When we pressed the capslock or shift key the software tells us that whatever follows this should be printed on the screen and after we have pressed the letter a which is a small letter, the software first converts it into binary like it had converted the shift or capslock key and then after the computer understands it prints A on the screen.
Related Concepts of Simple Understanding 

Some related concepts that can help in understanding computers include:

    Binary code: Computers communicate and process information using a binary code, which is a system of ones and zeroes. Each binary digit (or bit) represents a simple “on” or “off” state, and combinations of bits can represent more complex information.
    Algorithms: An algorithm is a set of instructions or steps that a computer program follows to solve a problem or complete a task. Algorithms are used to perform a wide range of tasks, from sorting data to searching for patterns.
    Programming languages: Programming languages are used to write computer programs. There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax and set of rules.
    Hardware vs. software: Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer, such as the CPU, memory, and storage devices. Software, on the other hand, refers to the programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do.
    Networks: Computers can be connected together in networks, which allows them to communicate and share resources. Networks can be wired or wireless and can be used for tasks such as sharing files, accessing the internet, or playing multiplayer games.
    User interfaces: User interfaces are the means by which humans interact with computers. They can be graphical, such as a desktop or mobile operating system, or text-based, such as a command line interface.
