SISC (Special Instruction Set Computing): a proposed new ias

proposing a new is a custom designed specifically for the purpose of getting maximum efficiency of performance from common commercial home pc's/gfx card when running llm and similar type 'ai's :

- this would benefit from some form of true parallel architecture type al la EPIC
- also employ some aspects of VLIW/LIW to adapt to the particular necessity for coping with particular repetitive use of certain long er but oft repeated calculations
- it would still benefit therefore from the longer instructions of cisc and other advantages yet he parallel nature e allowing the running of adaptations also to risc type architecture aspects wen needed or best suited for other calculations.
- finally, all this could be achieved without altering hardware by adapting the controller specifically as far as instruction issue and scheduling were handled. 

it may be worth looking into misc and iosc architecture benefits to see if any adaptations can be drawn from those architectures also.

ive been referring to this custom isa as Special Instruction Set Computer or SISC in my head.
