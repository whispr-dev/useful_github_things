SIC/XE Architecture

SIC/XE stands for Simplified Instructional Computer Extra Equipment or Extra Expensive.

This computer is an advance version of SIC. Both SIC and SIC/XE are closely related to each other that’s why they are Upward Compatible. 

SIC/XE machine architecture:

 1. Memory: Memory consists of 8 bit-bytes and the memory size is 1 megabytes (220 bytes). Standard SIC memory size is very small. This change in the memory size leads to change in the instruction formats as well as addressing modes. 3 consecutive bytes form a word (24 bits) in SIC/XE architecture. All address are byte addresses and words are addressed by the location of their lowest numbered byte.


2. Registers: It contain 9 registers (5 SIC registers + 4 additional registers). Four additional registers are:

Mnemonics             			Use of Register
           B                 		 Base register
           S                  		General working register
           T                  		General working register
           F                  		Floating-point accumulator


3. Data Formats:
-    Integers are represented by Binary numbers.
-    Characters are represented using ASCII codes.
-    Floating points are represented using 48-bits.


4. Instruction formats:
-    In SIC/XE architecture there are 4 types of formats available
-    The Bit(e) is used to distinguish between Formats 3 and Formats 4,

   ` e=0 means Format 3 and e=1 means Format 4`

Format 1(1 byte):			8
							opcode

Format 2(2 bytes):			8			4			4
							opcode		reg1		reg2

Format 3(3 bytes):			6		1	1	1	1	1	1			12	
							opcode	n	i	x	b	p	e		displacement

Format 4(4 bytes):			6		1	1	1	1	1	1		20
							opcode	n	i	x	b	p	e		addess

*n=Indirect mode, i=Immediate addressing, x=Index addressing, b=Base addressing, p= Program counter, e=Exponential addressing*


5. Addressing Modes: To use Format 3 use of Base register and Program counter is there. 
		
			Mode             		  	Indication 	         Target Address (TA) 
         		Base relative    	  	b=1, p=0	            	 TA=(B) + displacement 
          		Program-counter	b=0, p=1  	         	 TA=(PC) + displacement 
          		relative

[Target address is the effective address of the instruction. ]


6. Instruction Set:

-    in SIC/XE all the instructions are same as that of SIC architecture but because of Floating point data format it provide Floating point Arithmetic functions too.
-    To perform floating-point arithmetic operations, 

	ADDF = Add floating points, 
	SUBF = Subtract floating points, 
	MULF = Multiply floating points, 
	DIVF = Divide floating points

- SVC (Supervisor call) is also provided in the SIC/XE architecture to handle Interrupts.


7. Input and Output: SIC/XE architecture include I/O channels that allow to perform I/O operations while CPU is executing other tasks. It will allow overlapping of computing and I/O, which make this architecture more efficient. Instructions such as SIO, TIO, HIO are used to start, test, and halt the operation I/O channels. 


Instruction Set used in SIC/XE

SIC/XE (Simplified Instructional Computer Extra Equipment or Extra Expensive). SIC/XE is an advanced version of SIC. Both SIC and SIC/XE are closely related to each other that’s why they are Upward Compatible.

Below mentioned are the instructions that are used in SIC/XE (Simplified Instructional Computer Extra Equipment or Extra Expensive) Architecture. You can view the instructions that are particularly used in SIC Architecture.

Before Proceeding to the table, we will be clear that M stands for Memory R1 and R2 are registers (A, B, S, T).

MNEMONIC	OPERAND	OPCODE	EXPLANATION
ADDR		R1, R2		90			R2 = R2 + R1
CLEAR		R1			04			R1 = 0
COMPR		R1, R2		A0			compares R1 and R2
DIVR		R1, R2		9C			R2 = R2 / R1
LDB		M			68			B = M
LDS		M			6C			S = M
LDT		M			74			T = M
MULR		R1, R2		98			R2 = R2 * R1
RMO		R1, R2		AC			R2 = R1
SHIFTL	R1, n		A4	left shifts R1 n times
SHIFTR	R1, n		A8	right shifts R1 n times
STB		M			78			M = B
STS		M			7C			M = S
STT		M			84			M = T
SUBR		R1, R2		94			R2 = R2 – R1
TIXR		R1			B8			X = X + 1; compares X and R1

Opcodes are simply the operation codes that help in representing specific machine instructions in the SIC/XE assembly language.
Immediate Addressing involves a constant value embedded in instruction itself instead of a address.
SIC/XE supports 5 types of addressing modes:
-        Simple (S)
-        Immediate (I)
-        Indirect (N)
-        Indexed (X)
-        Extended (B)
