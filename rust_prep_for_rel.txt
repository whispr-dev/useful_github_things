Putting It All Together
So a typical minimal file-size approach might look like:

Update Cargo.toml (optional, but nice):
`[profile.release]
to = true
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1`



`cargo build --release`



Strip (GNU example):

`strip target/release/<your_project_name>.exe`

Distribute your super-slim .exe to your heartâ€™s content!
